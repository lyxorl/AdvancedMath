complex number :
c(a,b) with real part : a
            imaginary part b
a and b are float

polynomial :
first int : degrees
next float and int  : coefficient from degree 0 to max degree
exemple :
3 1 1 2 3 give this polynomial : "X^3 + 2X^2 + 1X + 1"


matrix :
| 1 2 3 4 |
| 4 5 6 7 |
| 8 9 5 1 |
| 1 8 9 1 |

define print with difference with determinant

    | 1 2 3 4 |
    | 4 5 6 7 |
det | 8 9 5 1 | good ?
    | 1 8 9 1 |
